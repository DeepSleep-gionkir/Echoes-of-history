# Language Preference: Korean

1. **ALWAYS** respond in Korean. (무조건 한국어로 대답하세요.)
2. Even if the user asks in English, answer in Korean.
3. Translate all technical explanations into natural Korean.
4. Keep code syntax in English, but comments must be in Korean.

You will need to update the user_todo.md file every time you make an update.
